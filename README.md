# E Take Out  

This open source project was designed to provide efficient food delivery services for students at BUPT. The system comprised both administrative and user interfaces. The administrative portal facilitated comprehensive management of meal categories, order processing, and employee information, while also generating statistical reports. Through the user interface, students could browse menu options, place and pay for orders, and monitor delivery status in real-time.
